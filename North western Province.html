           <p>Kalpitiya is one of the best locations in Sri Lanka for dolphin and whale watching.
              Kalpitiya gives you an opportunity to watch hundreds of dolphins swimming alongside and diving under your boat, riding waves, jumping, spinning, twirling and leaping out of the water in a magical display, is a magnificent experience you will never forget in your lifetime.
              <br>
              <br>
              Best dolphin and whale watching season in Kalpitiya  Sri Lanka is from Mid October until end of March! During these months large schools of the playful spinner dolphins are dwelling just three nautical miles out, in front of Kappalady beach. 
              Another 2 miles further out the continental shelf is breaks steeply into the deep ocean. 
              Because of the converging deep currents and the rich sea life this is the preferred habitat for the blue whale, sperm whale and grey whale - the largest mammals which have ever inhabited our planet.
