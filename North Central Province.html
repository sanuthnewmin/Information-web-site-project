     <p>The environment around the Sigiriya may have been inhabited since prehistoric times. 
         There is clear evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BC. 
         The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied nearly five thousand years ago during the Mesolithic Period.

        Buddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. 
        Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. 
        Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. 
        These were made in the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century AD.

        <br>
        In 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king’s son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara, the King’s nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India.
         Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa’s reign (477 to 495 AD), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress. 
         Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Culavamsa describes King Kashyapa as the son of King Dhatusena.
         Kashyapa murdered his father by walling him up alive and then usurping the throne which rightfully belonged to his half-brother Moggallana, Dhatusena's son by the true queen. 
         Moggallana fled to India to escape being assassinated by Kashyapa, but vowed revenge. <br> <br> In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka, which he considered to be rightfully his. 
         Expecting the inevitable return of Moggallana, Kashyapa is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress as well as a pleasure palace. Moggallana finally arrived, declared war, and defeated Kashyapa in 495 CE.
          During the battle Kashyapa's armies abandoned him and he committed suicide by falling on his sword.

         <p>A vaṭadāge is a type of Buddhist structure found in Sri Lanka. 
             It also known as a dage, thupagara and a cetiyagara. Although it may have had some Indian influence, it is a structure that is more or less unique to the architecture of ancient Sri Lanka.
              Vatadages were built around small stupas for their protection, which often enshrined a relic or were built on hallowed ground. Circular in shape, they were commonly built of stone and brick and adorned with elaborate stone carvings. 
              Vatadages may have also had a wooden roof, supported by a number of stone columns arranged in several concentric rows.
              <br>
              <br>
              Only ten vatadages now remain in Sri Lanka. 
              The builders of many of these monuments are unknown, as are their time of creation. The oldest such construction is believed to be the one surrounding the Thuparamaya. 
              The best example of a vatadage is generally believed to be the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. Along with it, the vatadages at Medirigiriya and Thiriyaya remain more or less intact.
