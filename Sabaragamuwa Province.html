      <p> Located on a hill near the Thalduwa Bridge, it is one of the finest stone carvings in Indian architecture. Kyotho says that the king employed 2000 people for 20 years and built the temple. AD In 1551, the combined forces of Kotte and Portugal attacked Seetha.
         Queiroz displays gold, silver statues, lamps, bells, and jewels that were completely destroyed and stolen from the Brandy Temple. 
         AD The Savul Sandeshaya, written around 1582, details the complete construction of the Brandi Kovil and the paintings on it, such as the Rama Ravana War / Maha Bharatha War, and a description of the offerings made at the Dibapatha Kovil.
        Although there is a folklore that King Rajasinghe of Seethawaka killed his father and embraced Shiva devotion and built the Brandi Kovil, there is no evidence to support this view. 
        We can conclude that King Maya built a separate temple for the Tamil army of his army.<br>
        <br> It was destroyed in 1551 and rebuilt by King Raja Sinharaja. 
        After the death of King Sinha Raja Seethawaka, the invaders invaded Seethawaka and destroyed the temple again.
        A number of carved stone slabs in front of the temple are missing today. 
        The architectural style and carvings here show Indian features.<br>
        <br> Three beautiful vases of the Indian style can be seen in the form of lotus flowers, binara flowers, leaf petals and lace nets. 
        The waterfall shaped like a lotus flower is a masterpiece. The outer wall of the courtyard had a parrot mark on it and was taken to the Sabaragamuwa Archaeological Office premises. The stone roof and no paintings can be seen today. 
        The Archaeological Department preserved the temple in 2005 using bricks.<br>
        <br>Stone slabs were brought from the upper reaches of the river to build the temple. The bridge made of 4 stone slabs found at the entrance to the Brandy Temple may also have been a masterpiece. 
        There are many slabs of stone cut and leveled around the temple which need to be identified and conserved. 
        It is clear that the Brandy Temple is one of the finest works of art depicting the Seethawaka period.

       <p>The mountain is located in the southern reaches of the Central Highlands in the Ratnapura District and Nuwara Eliya district of the Sabaragamuwa Province and Central Province —lying about 40 km (25 mi) northeast of Ratnapura and 32 km (20 mi) southwest of Hatton. 
         The surrounding region is largely forested hills, with no mountain of comparable size nearby. The region along the mountain is a wildlife reserve, housing many species varying from elephants to leopards, and including many endemic species.
         <br>
         <br>
        Adam's Peak is important as a watershed. 
        The districts to the south and the east of Adam's Peak yield precious stones—emeralds, rubies and sapphires, for which the island has been famous, and which earned for it the ancient name of Ratnadvipa.
        <br>
        <br>
        Adam's Peak is the source of three major rivers in Sri Lanka: Kelani River, Walawe River, and the Kalu Ganga (river).
