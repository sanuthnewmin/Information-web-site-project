      <p> Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya is an ancient Buddhist monastery located in Hambantota District, South Eastern Sri Lanka. Situated 18 km east of the pilgrimage town Katharagama, it is believed to have been built in the 2nd century B.C by king Kavantissa.
        <br> <br> Sithulpawwa Vihara can be reached by travelling 18 miles along the Tissamaharama-Yodhakandiya road towards the Yala National Park.
           The name Sithulpawwa is derived from the word "Chiththala Pabbatha", which means "the hill of the quiet mind".
           <br>
           <br>
           This monastery was a place of worship for devotees as well as a center of Buddhist education for Buddhist monks.
            Paintings of the Anuradhapura era and the ruins of stone Buddha images, Bodhisattva images, Image Houses, Circular Relic Houses are spread throughout the monastery premises. 
            The present chief incumbent of Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Vihara is Ven. Metaramba Hemarathana Nayake Thera.[2]

       <p>Hummanaya is a natural blowhole, and caused when sea water rushes through a submerged cavern and is pushed upwards. The sea water flows underneath the shore, and then comes out of this hole due to pressure. 
           <br>
           <br>
           The water fountain created by the geological feature shoots up every couple of minutes, depending on the nature of the sea, with the spray often reaching as high as 25 m (82 ft) to 30 m (98 ft).
           <br>
           <br>
           this Blow Hole is one of the more intriguing attractions in Tangalle. 
           The blow hole gets its name from the fact that it blows huge fountains of water up in the air due to pressure build up in the gorge.
            Located in a small fishing village known as Kudawella, the Hummanya Blow Hole is a mere 30-minute drive from either of our private villas in Tangalle.
